1-I reworked everything the username and password for login is admin and admin123 
2-you will be logged in whether you put right or wrong crdientials but without logging in if you try to delete anything you will be
redirected to login page
3-I did not add error page so if you try update or insert info that cause problems with foreign key you will see development query
error page
4-you can use debug mode or dotnet run and go to localhost url
5-make sure this the listening localhost "http://localhost:5117"
